Last night I read Keith Schwarz's article about Vose's *alias method* for
simulating rolls of a loaded die:

"Gosh," I thought, "what an elegant and efficient algorithm! I wonder if anyone
has put an implementation of it on CPAN?"

So I looked. And, as far as I can tell, they haven't.

So I wrote this implementation on the bus this morning.

You're welcome.
